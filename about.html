              We're Atomic Theory, and FTC robotics out of the Dalton School in New York NY.
            </p>
              
<p>Our team is run slightly differently from others. We operate as a class at The Dalton School. This means that we meet twice a week during school to discuss team strategy and fundraising. Additionally, we have build sessions on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays after school and on Saturdays when we work on building and programming the robot.</p>

<p>Because we are a class, we receive some fundraising from our school, but in order to buy the materials we need, we also must seek other revenue sources. As such, we have partnered with Knotts Co., a local 80/20 distribution to receive a reduced price for components vital to our robot. For team apparel, we will be seeking a grant from our school’s Student Government. Our leadership is another unique quality of Atomic Theory. We make all decisions as a full team. Minor changes are often discussed in small groups and adopted through acclamation. We have a captain who is in charge of logistics and moderating team discussions. Aside from that, we often switch tasks so that everybody has a chance to experience all aspects of FTC. On our team, every member, regardless of their seniority is equal and their opinions are seriously considered.</p> 

<p>As a class, we need to be graded. Our teacher begins each class with what we call a “micro-lecture”. A micro-lecture covers a physics or engineering concept that we then apply to improving the robot. The topics range from torque to electromagnetism. Every few weeks, we have an assessment. This measures the progress of our robot vs. some aspect of the game (e.g. autonomous only). Our grades are determined by the robot’s performance on assessments, from an autonomous assessment that measures our robot’s performance during the autonomous period, to a midterm where we have to score 10,000 points in 2 weeks that encourages as much driver practice as possible. We find that operating as a class provides both support and structure that we find vital to our ability to function as a team.</p>

<p>We always try to adhere to the seven norms of collaboration listed below:

<ol>

<li> Pausing </li>
<li> Paraphrasing </li>
<li> Posing questions </li>
<li> Putting ideas on the table </li>
<li> Providing data </li>
<li> Paying attention to self and others </li>
<li> Presuming positive intentions </li>

</ol>
