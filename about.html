We’re Team 4174, Standard Model, from the Dalton School in New York City.

</p>

<p> We operate as a class, which means that we meet twice a week during school and once optionally during lunch on Wednesdays when we discuss fundraising. We also have optional build sessions every day after school and on Saturdays. 
</p>
<p>
  Standard Model has existed as an FTC team for the past five years. We’ve had our highs and lows, and last year we represented New York City in the FTC World Championship and came in Second Place in the world! Standard Model has students of varying experience, ranging from first year robotics students to fifth year students. Our new students provide a fresh perspective to the robot building process while veteran members can lend their expertise in building techniques. We foster an accepting environment in which every team member, regardless of robotics experience, plays an active role in designing, building, and programming the robot. Leo, a first year robotics student, is a dedicated member of our team; he thinks of  inventive ideas to better the robot and thoroughly prototypes. We always try to use innovative and creative solutions to build our robots, and we are not afraid of failure, because that is how we figure out what works.. We were one of the first teams to use a tape measure to do the pull-up; at our first few competitions, teams came over to us, curious about our robot’s tape measure mechanism. We shared our process in creating the tape measure and the engineering knowledge we had gathered because fostering a community of awesome engineering is more important to us than keeping our robot’s design a secret.
  We’ve had a bit of success in the FTC competition thus far, as a part of the winning the innovate award at two competitions, and the 2nd place Inspire and Winning Alliance awards at the Gravesend West FTC tournament.
</p>
<p>
  Gracious Professionalism plays just as large of a role in the way we run our team and the way we design our robot. As a team that has a lot of knowledge about robotics and computer science, we are always eager to share our knowledge, expertise, and we are not afraid to get our hands dirty. If a team needs help programming their robot, we will be eager to help and make sure that they will able to compete in the robot game. 
</p>
<p>
  The FIRST and engineering communities are very important to our team. Some of our contributions include hosting an FLL tournament and working on a water quality probe for The Billion Oyster Project, an initiative that is using science to try to repopulate the oyster populations of New York Harbor.
